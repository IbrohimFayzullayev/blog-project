          &emsp;Many responses reflect the participants’ sense of belonging and
          identification with the group. For example, Vedat talks about how he
          gradually became more active in the group, even sharing his personal
          photos and thoughts. Rayyan also mentions how the “supportive”
          atmosphere in the group allows him to feel free to share his views.
          These feelings of belonging and comfort are key aspects of social
          presence. SPT stresses that a sense of belonging, built through
          regular interaction and positive engagement, enhances social presence.
          The more connected participants feel to the group, the more they
          engage in activities, which leads to better learning outcomes.
          <br /> &emsp; eg:{" "}
          <i>
            “Yes, I feel free to share my view within this community as I find
            everyone supportive.”
          </i>
          — Rayyan.{" "}
          <i>
            “Yeah, I do feel comfortable to ask questions or share my ideas.”
          </i>{" "}
          - Vedat.

          Moreover, Gibson (2001) points out that emotional support in online
          communication promotes a sense of belonging, which is key to social
          presence. The supportive messages, even in their informal, humorous
          form, enable group members to feel like they are part of a community
          that cares for one another. This sense of belonging enhances the
          social presence that participants experience in the group. <br />{" "}
          &emsp; For example,{" "}
          <i>
            “There is a friendly bond between those who are active and they can
            chat and discuss freely.”
          </i>{" "}

          &emsp;Social Presence Theory emphasizes the feeling of being “with”
          others, even in virtual environments. Collected data shows how
          participants feel comfortable interacting, sharing their thoughts, and
          asking questions in the group, which aligns with the theory’s emphasis
          on emotional and social presence
          <br /> &emsp; The data demonstrates that Social Presence Theory
          remains highly relevant in explaining the dynamics of virtual
          communities, especially in online groups focused on language learning
          and social interaction. Humor, emotional support, and informal
          communication are key factors that increase social presence, making
          online interactions feel more personal and authentic. The
          conversations captured in the data reflect how participants build a
          strong sense of connection, despite the technological mediation,
          supporting the notion that social presence is not just about being
          “seen” but about feeling truly present in an online interaction.
