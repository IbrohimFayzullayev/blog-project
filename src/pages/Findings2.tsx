          &emsp;Research also emphasizes the importance of mutual support of
          learning in fostering a strong sense of social presence. According to
          Joinson (2007), virtual communities thrive on social support, where
          participants provide emotional and informational support to each
          other. Participants like Abdurahmon and Mohammad emphasize mutual
          learning and correcting each other’s mistakes. For example, Abdurahmon
          talks about how group members help each other improve their English by
          chatting and correcting mistakes. This mutual support is a critical
          aspect of social presence, as it fosters a sense of community and
          encourages active engagement. <br /> &emsp;e.g.,{" "}
          <i>
            “What motivated me to participate in the group's activities was
            finding new friends who were interested in learning and teaching
          </i>
          English.” Abdurahman • <br />
          &emsp; Social Presence Theory highlights the role of mutual support in
          creating a positive learning environment. When learners feel that they
          are part of a community where they can receive feedback and help
          others, they are more likely to engage actively and remain motivated.
          This reciprocal support is evident in how participants exchange
          learning experiences and correct each other’s mistakes. <br /> &emsp;
          Mohammad’s statement, “We all learn from each other here,” emphasizes
          that the group is a space for mutual support and knowledge exchange.
          It shows the group’s collaborative and supportive nature, contributing
          to social presence by fostering a sense of belonging and community.{" "}
          <br /> &emsp;The way participants feel motivated and supported by
          peers in the group—like Mohammad, who mentions the motivation to
          improve English, or Rayyan, who talks about improving fluency—points
          to the role of social presence in fostering intrinsic motivation to
          learn. <br /> &emsp; Additionally, participants like Abdurahmon and
          Rayyan describe the group’s dynamic, which includes a mix of
          competitiveness and support. Rayyan mentions that the atmosphere is
          both “supportive and competitive,” suggesting that the group strikes a
          balance between encouragement and a desire to improve. This kind of
          group dynamic can enhance the social presence by keeping participants
          engaged and motivated. SPT discusses how group dynamics, like friendly
          competition and support, influence how individuals perceive others in
          the group and their communication with them. A balanced group dynamic
          increases social presence by making participants feel both challenged
          and supported in their learning.
