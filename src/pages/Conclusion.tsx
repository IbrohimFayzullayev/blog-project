        acquisition. We have to recognize what is the main learning part of
        language. <br /> <b>2.</b> By analyzing the long-term effects of online
        learning groups on language proficiency we can have a idea of the impact
        of online learning community.
        <br /> <b>3.</b> Additional research can be customized by giving
        instruction on community-based platforms.
        <br /> <b>4</b> Analyzing how prolonged participation in online groups
        affects our language acquisition beyond the immediate learning context.{" "}
        <br /> <b>5.</b> Investigating the role of personalized learning
        pathways tailored to individual participants’ goals and proficiencies
        within online groups. Because every learners does not have same
