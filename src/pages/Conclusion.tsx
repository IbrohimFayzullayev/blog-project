      <p>
        By incorporating Social Presence Theory into the theme analysis, we can
        understand how the social, emotional, and cognitive aspects of presence
        influence how people engage with the group. And Thematic analysis
        recognized components like community involvement, motivation, and ease
        of engagement that are critical to creating a strong social presence in
        an online learning environment.By applying these themes we got to
         understand  that how participants' sense of being "active" in the group
        affects their communication methods and learning experiences in social
        community.

        1.Analyzing the effects of online community structure (e.g., group size,
        frequency of contact)  which is based on language acquisition. We have
        to recognize what is the main learning part of language. <br /> 2.By
        analyzing the long-term effects of online learning groups on language
        proficiency we can have a idea of the impact of online learning
        community.
        <br /> 3. Additional research can be customized by giving instruction on
        community-based platforms.
        <br /> 4. Analyzing how prolonged participation in online groups affects
        our language acquisition beyond the immediate learning context. <br />{" "}
        5. Investigating the role of personalized learning pathways tailored to
        individual participants’ goals and proficiencies within online groups.
        Because every learners does not have same motivation to join in a online

        This requires being awared by a person of how expectations,
        communication preferences, and cultural norms affect motivation,
        engagement, and learning results in language learning environments.
        People from different countries have different issues on learning second
        or foreign language. And for that reason they should behave in their own
        ways including norms and ethics.

        The development of more efficient online learning environments and
        community-driven teaching strategies can be influenced by further study
        in these areas. For better learning sometimes the teachers and platform
        developers may design environments that not only support cognitive
        learning objectives but also promote emotional connection,
        cross-cultural interchange, and a long-lasting feeling of community by
