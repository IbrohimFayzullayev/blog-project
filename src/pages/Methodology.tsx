      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        The participants for this study are members of an online language
        learning community on the Telegram platform who actively engage in
        improving their English language skills. Studied online community
        (English with Masters) where 9,816 members from different backgrounds
        joined to enhance their English. Nearly fifteen moderators control group
        interaction and follow community rules and restrictions. They organize
        different online classes, such as quiz time, speaking, and vocabulary
        classes.

        Data was collected from individuals ranging from early learners to
        advanced speakers, across different age groups and nationalities. For
        instance, participants like Abdurahmon (18, Uzbekistan), Mohammad (39,
        Iran), Vedat (Turkey), Peace, Rayyan (India), and Fateme (Iran) provide
        rich insights into how diverse backgrounds influence perceptions of
        social presence and engagement in learning environments. A purposeful
        sampling method was used to find these active members of this online ESL
        community who frequently interact in the group and are engaged to learn
        language. Informed consent about the scope of our research, their right
        to withdraw, and how their data was used, was shared in their private
        space of the Telegram application. Moreover, their consent was taken to
        use personal information and photos of profiles for study purposes.{" "}

        As a data collection, observation of textual interaction of the online
        ESL community, active participant interviews, and multimedia data (e.g.,
        sharing photos, using personal names, videos, emoji) were gathered.
        Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore in depth the
        experiences of the participants in the community and insights regarding
        the role of social presence in their learning. Open-ended questions
        helped to focus on how they perceive the level of connection with other
        members and its impact on their learning motivation. As a sharing tool,
        the Telegram application functions allowed us to collect all the data:
        shared learning videos, discussion chats, voice recordings, and
        presentations posted by the community.The platform of Zoom was used to
        organize interviews with active participants and record them. These
        recordings were transcribed manually for analysis.

        A qualitative analysis of online conversations and interactions within
        the groups involves analyzing message content, frequency of
        participation, and the presence of personalized communication (e.g.,
        sharing photos, using personal names, or engaging in friendly
        banter).Manually coding and thematic content analyses were used to code
        and analyze the textual data and multimedia data, identify recurring
        themes, and map interactions within the community.
