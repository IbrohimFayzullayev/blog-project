          1. Emotional Presence and Social Concern:
        </h2>
        <p className="content-text">
          &emsp;Some participants of the community (such as Fateme, Rayyan,
          Abdurahmon, and others) highlight the sense of belonging and emotional
          comfort they feel in the group. For example, Fateme feels comfortable
          due to “the lovely and friendly virtual friends” in the community,
          which speaks to the emotional presence in online interactions.
          Similarly, Mohammad mentions that the group has a “friendly bond”
          where participants can chat and discuss freely

          Furthermore, Mohammad asks about Peace, showing care and attention for
          the absence or wellbeing of another member. This is a demonstration of
          emotional presence in online interactions. Fateme responds about
          Peace’s lack of response, continuing the interaction with a sense of
          relational concern. These exchanges reflect emotional bonding, a key
          aspect of social presence

          &emsp;• The participants show emotional engagement with each other
          (e.g., “Fateme Don’t reveal that you care so much about me” or “U r so
          caring too”). This indicates a sense of being “present” Emotional

          informality Sense of belonging “U r so caring too” “the lovely and
          friendly virtual friends” “We all learn from each other here,” “What
          motivated me to participate in the group's activities was finding new
          friends who were interested in learning and teaching English.” “What
          the hell guys why you leave me alone with Fateme? I feel myself as
          captured a lion in a cage with Fateme” “Yes, I feel free to share my
          view within this community as I find everyone supportive.”
          emotionally, even in a virtual environment. SPT emphasizes that social
          presence is about how real and personal interactions feel in a virtual
          space. These exchanges suggest a high level of personal engagement and
          social closeness despite the distance, which aligns with the theory’s
          focus on building relationships in online communication. In these
          interactions, participants demonstrate concern and support for
          well-being of each other’ (e.g., “Let me blow on your face my breath
          is so cure and it cures people’s healthy problem so quickly,” and “I
          feel cold even under blanket”). This creates an interpersonal bond
          that is essential to social presence, where participants care about
          each other and share personal experiences, even in an online
          setting.One member of the community shared a personal milestone—their
          first solo art exhibition. Sharing such personal events helps to
          establish a sense of presence by inviting others into personal life
          experiences, thereby enhancing emotional connection. <br />{" "}
          &emsp;Another member, Javad, offers encouragement to one of the
          members for their upcoming art exhibition by saying, “Good luck with
          your exhibition; I will keep my fingers crossed for you.” This
          illustrates social support and shows how members encourage and care
          for one another’s personal endeavors, a vital part of fostering social
          presence.
