        Social Presence Theory (SPT) has usually been used to explain how a
        person feels as though he or she is "there" in virtual settings. The
        main focus of SPT, which was first presented by Short, Williams, and
        Christie in 1976, was media richness theory and the extent to which
        communication technologies may express social presence in interpersonal
        meetings. The researcher aimed to investigate how online communication
        promotes social relationships, emotional connection, and a feeling of
        community in the virtual world. In particular, the concept has been
        applied to study communication patterns in online communities, such as
        social networking sites or language-learning groups. Researchers found
        that interactions—despite being mediated by technology—can be felt as
        very personal and emotionally engaging. When the scope of SPT expanded
        along with the development of digital communication technology, that was
        also when they started looking at its use in virtual and online
        settings. In this sense, meaningful interactions may still be made even
        in the absence of physical co-presence contextually. By textual
        communication, visual and auditory cues in online communication, and
        social presence. For instance, even if they have never met in person,
        participants in virtual language exchange groups may form close
        emotional ties and feel supported. But in real life it is sometimes
        problematic for an introverted person to communicate with the new people
        but with the online community, it eases the communication. Additionally,
        we can say SPT combines psychological and affective theories to
        investigate how social presence affects motivation, engagement, and
        pleasure in a variety of contexts, including healthcare and online
        education. We can encourage engagement through discussion boards, video
        lectures, and group projects; for example, teachers may improve
        students' feelings of social presence in online learning, making virtual
        classrooms feel less alienating and more linked.

        Likewise, Vygotsky’s Sociocultural Theory (1978) emphasizes the
        importance of social interaction in cognitive development, with language
        serving as a key tool for this process. The idea that language
        facilitates social interaction directly relates to the discussion of
        virtual language exchange. Even though participants may not be
        physically co-present, communication technologies enable them to engage
        socially and linguistically, promoting cognitive and language
        development. The Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) and scaffolding are
        evident in virtual interactions, where learners can receive support from
        more knowledgeable peers, even if they’ve never met in person. The
        shared repertoire of language learners in online groups mirrors Lave and
        Wenger’s (1991) concept of Communities of Practice (CoP), where members
        engage in mutual learning, share resources, and develop shared
        knowledge, collaborating and learning together despite geographical
        distance.
